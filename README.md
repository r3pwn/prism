# What is Prism?
Prism is a class project that aims to use MPI to create an environment that allows for parallelized Rainbow Table generation.

# Why not use rtgen?
Due to some constraints on the environment used to run the project, we had to create our own rainbow table generator, and Python 2.7 was the only version we were able to use.
